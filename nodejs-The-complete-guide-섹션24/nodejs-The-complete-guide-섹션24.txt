REST API

왜 사용 하고 무엇인가

모든 Frontend가 HTML, 탬플릿 엔진을 사용 하지 않는다. 
모바일 앱, 싱글 페이지 웹 앱, service APIs

그러므로 데이터만을 필요로 한다. 이를 위해서 Rest API를 설계한다.

여러가지 다른 종류의 response가 필요하기 때문에

서버안의 로직과는 상관없이 데이터 포맷을 통일화 시키는 것이 목적. 


rest API or rest stands for 
Representaional State Transfer
the simple translation i like to use is that we transfer data instead of user interface

instead of html, we just transfer data and we leave it to the client or to the frontend,
be that a mobile app, be that a single page application

we leave it to that frontend to then do with this data whatever it wants to do.
(키 포인트)
a decoupled frontend or you might need to and then rest APIs are the solution. 

only the response and the request data changes but not the general server side logic

you do that in exactly the same way when building a Rest API and that is really important to me because

often, Rest APIs and traditional web apps where you render the views on the server are seen as

two totally different things.

they only differ in the response and in the kind of data you expect but they dont differ

what happens on the server

data format은 json이 이겼다. 





Reason for using Rest API
Not every Frontend (UI) requires HTML Pages

ex) 
Mobile Apps == Java, swifts, C IOS 

Single page web app  

Service APIs

it's not the frontend that requires us to build a rest API on own 

but this is another example for a case
where you only need the data and no user interface

we just have a backend that needs to serve us data and 
that is a core idea or that is the core idea of building rest api

APIs becuase there we need a different kind of response. And rest API or rest stands for 
Representaional State Transfer
the simple translation i like to use is that we transfer data instead of user interface
