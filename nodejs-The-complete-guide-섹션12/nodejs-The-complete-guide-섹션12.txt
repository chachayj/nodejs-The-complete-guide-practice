one major purpose, that you could store and work

large scale applications


example mongodb is schemaless, inside of one collection, your documents 
which is your data, your entry so to say don't have to have the same structure. 
In SQL that was totally different,



Let's say here, some user data for the orders and you copy that into the orders
and then you have that data right there whenever you fetch all orders without you having to fetch all
orders, then look for the fitting users and fetch them too
and this is part of what makes NoSQL and especially mongodb so fast and efficient.

We can still build relations manually with references as you saw but you should always know if that
is the best approach right now
or if you can use an embedded document with too much work.
So these are NoSQL characteristics and therefore the mongodb characteristics
and these are also part of the reason why mongodb is so popular because of the speed and the flexibility

몽고 db의 find() 메소드는 하나 찾고 그다음 찾고 그다음 찾고
ID의 objectId라는 특별한 값.

타입은 매번 변형하기보다는 model에서 받을때 맞춰서 받아주는게 좋다. 

deleteOne()


so _id down there will always be defined
and if it's just such an empty or automatically generated object id object, this should be the issue here.

id

id 객체를 항상 새로 생성해서 문제가 된것. 

insertOne()


products와 users의 관계를 맺을때는 userid를 넣어서 만들게한다.
